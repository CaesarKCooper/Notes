S.O.L.I.D principles

5 Concepts of SOLID principles

1. Single responsibility

* class should on have one responsibility, should only have one reason to change
class will have fewer test cases
less functional classes will have fewer dependencies
smaller classes are easier to search

2. Open/Closed

* classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
instead of directly modifying existing code which can add new bugs, extend off of existing code

3. Liskov Substitution

* you should be able to replace a subtype of a class with the class and the program should make sense
if motor car class implements car interface then car methods should work on any car 

4. Interface Segregation

* larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones
this allows us to only implement what is necessary for specific classes

5. Dependency Inversion

* High level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions
* Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstraction
